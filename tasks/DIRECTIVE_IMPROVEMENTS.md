# Tasks Directive Improvements Summary

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Behavioral Contract Section
Added requirement to define complete interface contracts including:
- All inputs/outputs
- Error response formats
- Integration points
- Invariants and constraints

**Why this helps**: Would have required specifying that errors return JSON format, not plain text.

### 2. Contract-Driven Testing
Enhanced testing requirements to ensure:
- Tests validate the complete behavioral contract
- Test data reflects real-world usage
- Cross-component integration is validated

**Why this helps**: Would have prevented test/implementation mismatches where tests expected plain text but implementation returned JSON.

### 3. Cross-Task Validation
New section requiring tasks to:
- Identify interfaces exposed/consumed
- Define shared data structures
- Specify compatibility requirements

**Why this helps**: Would have caught inconsistencies between POST handler implementation and its tests.

### 4. System Coherence
Added development principle to:
- Validate consistency with existing components
- Ensure contracts align across task boundaries
- Verify end-to-end scenarios

**Why this helps**: Would have identified missing imports and unused imports during development.

### 5. Task Definition Excellence
New section emphasizing:
- Completeness Principle (What, How, Why, With, Proof)
- System Thinking (no task in isolation)
- Executable Specifications

**Why this helps**: Forces comprehensive task definition that prevents ambiguity.

### 6. Pre-Completion Validation
Additional quality gates for:
- Behavioral contracts validated
- Cross-task integration verified
- Interface compatibility confirmed

**Why this helps**: Would have caught all issues before marking tasks complete.

## Core Philosophy

The improvements focus on ensuring tasks:
1. Define complete contracts, not just features
2. Work as part of a system, not in isolation
3. Have verifiable, executable specifications
4. Consider integration from the start

These generic principles would have prevented the specific issues we encountered while remaining applicable to any project.
