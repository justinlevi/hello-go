## User Story
As a developer
I want structured logging and proper error handling
So that I can monitor, debug, and maintain the application effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
- Structured logging with log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Request/response logging with duration
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Error responses follow consistent format
- No sensitive data in logs
- Configurable log output (stdout/file)
- Panic recovery middleware
- Health check endpoint at /health

## Gherkin Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Logging and Error Handling

Scenario: Request logging
  Given the server is running
  When I make any request
  Then the request should be logged with method, path, status, duration
  And include a unique correlation ID

Scenario: Error response format
  Given the server is running
  When an error occurs
  Then response should contain {"error": "message", "code": "ERROR_CODE"}
  And appropriate HTTP status code

Scenario: Health check
  Given the server is running
  When I GET /health
  Then I receive 200 with {"status": "healthy"}
```

## Testing & Validation Steps
- Unit tests for logging functions
- Verify log output format
- Test panic recovery
- Validate error response structure
- Performance impact of logging
- Test log rotation if implemented
- Security review of logged data
