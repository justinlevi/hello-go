## User Story
As an API consumer
I want to receive JSON responses from the /hello endpoint
So that I can parse structured data in my client applications

## Acceptance Criteria
- Response struct defined with proper JSON tags
- Handler function returns JSON with "Hello, World!" message
- Content-Type header set to "application/json"
- Response includes proper HTTP status code (200)
- JSON encoding handles errors gracefully
- Response format is consistent and well-formed

## Gherkin Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: JSON Response Handler

Scenario: Successful JSON response
  Given the server is running
  When I send a GET request to /hello
  Then I should receive a 200 status code
  And the Content-Type should be "application/json"
  And the response body should contain {"message": "Hello, World!"}

Scenario: JSON encoding error handling
  Given the server is running
  When JSON encoding fails
  Then the server should return a 500 status code
  And log the error appropriately
```

## Testing & Validation Steps
- Unit test for JSON marshalling
- Verify correct Content-Type header
- Test response structure and content
- Validate proper error handling
- Performance test for JSON encoding
- Test with various HTTP clients
