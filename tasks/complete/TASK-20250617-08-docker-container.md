## User Story
As a DevOps engineer
I want to containerize the Go API application
So that I can deploy it consistently across different environments

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for minimal image size
- Final image based on scratch or alpine
- Binary compiled with CGO_ENABLED=0
- Container runs as non-root user
- Health check configured in Dockerfile
- Docker Compose file for local development
- Image size under 20MB
- Kubernetes deployment manifest included

## Gherkin Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Container Support

Scenario: Docker build
  Given the Dockerfile exists
  When I run docker build
  Then the image builds successfully
  And the final image is under 20MB

Scenario: Container runtime
  Given the container image is built
  When I run the container
  Then the API is accessible on port 8080
  And health checks pass

Scenario: Kubernetes deployment
  Given the deployment manifest exists
  When I apply it to a cluster
  Then pods start successfully
  And service is accessible
```

## Testing & Validation Steps
- Build Docker image successfully
- Verify image size optimization
- Test container starts and stops gracefully
- Validate health check endpoint
- Security scan container image
- Test Kubernetes deployment
- Verify resource limits set
- Test horizontal pod autoscaling
