# TASK-20250617-09 - Create GitHub Actions CI Pipeline
Status: COMPLETE
Priority: HIGH
Assignee: TBD

## User Story
As a developer
I want automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
So that code quality is enforced and tests run on every push/PR

## Acceptance Criteria
- GitHub Actions workflow created in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Workflow triggers on push to main and all pull requests
- Go environment properly configured with correct version
- Dependencies installed and cached for performance
- All tests run with verbose output
- Test coverage reported and visible
- Build verification included
- Workflow completes successfully on first run

## Gherkin Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: CI Pipeline

Scenario: Successful test run on push
  Given code is pushed to the repository
  When GitHub Actions workflow triggers
  Then Go environment is set up
  And dependencies are installed
  And all tests pass
  And coverage is reported

Scenario: Failed test blocks merge
  Given a PR contains failing tests
  When the CI pipeline runs
  Then the workflow fails
  And the PR cannot be merged
  And failure details are visible

Scenario: Dependency caching
  Given the workflow has run before
  When it runs again with no dependency changes
  Then cached dependencies are used
  And the workflow completes faster
```

## Testing & Validation Steps
- Workflow syntax validation passes
- Test workflow on a test branch before main
- Verify workflow triggers on push and PR events
- Confirm Go version matches project requirements
- Validate test output is properly displayed
- Check coverage reports are generated
- Ensure failures block PR merges
- Verify caching improves subsequent runs

## Behavioral Contract
- **Inputs**:
  - Git push or pull request events
  - Source code and test files
  - go.mod for dependency management
- **Outputs**:
  - Pass/fail status visible in GitHub
  - Detailed test output in logs
  - Coverage percentage displayed
  - Build artifacts (if applicable)
- **Side Effects**:
  - PR merge blocked on failure
  - Status checks updated
  - Caches created/updated
- **Integration Points**:
  - GitHub PR status checks
  - Repository settings for branch protection

## Parent/Sub Tasks
- Parent Task: None
- Sub Tasks: 
  - Future: Add linting checks
  - Future: Add security scanning
  - Future: Add release automation
- Dependencies: 
  - Repository must be on GitHub
  - Go project structure established

## Cross-Task Validation
- Workflow must test all code from previous tasks
- Must respect project Go version from TASK-20250617-01
- Should run all tests created in TASK-20250617-04
- Must handle all source files without special configuration
- Should align with development standards in tasks directive

## Implementation Notes
- Use official actions/setup-go action
- Implement dependency caching with actions/cache
- Run tests with coverage flags
- Consider matrix strategy for multiple Go versions (future)
- Add badge to README.md showing build status
- Use consistent workflow naming conventions
