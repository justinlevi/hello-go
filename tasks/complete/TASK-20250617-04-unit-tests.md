# TASK-20250617-04 - Write Unit Tests
Status: COMPLETE
Priority: HIGH
Assignee: TBD

## User Story
As a developer
I want comprehensive unit tests for the API server
So that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests achieve minimum 85% code coverage
- Tests use net/http/httptest package
- All handler functions have corresponding tests
- Tests cover success and error scenarios
- Tests are fast and deterministic
- Test files follow Go naming conventions (*_test.go)
- Tests can run in parallel where appropriate

## Gherkin Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: Unit Test Coverage

Scenario: Handler test coverage
  Given the hello handler is implemented
  When I run go test with coverage
  Then the handler should have >90% coverage
  And all edge cases should be tested

Scenario: Test execution
  Given all tests are written
  When I run go test ./...
  Then all tests should pass
  And complete in under 1 second
```

## Testing & Validation Steps
- Create main_test.go file
- Test helloHandler with httptest.NewRecorder
- Verify JSON response structure
- Test error conditions
- Run coverage reports with go test -cover
- Benchmark critical paths
- Validate test isolation and independence
