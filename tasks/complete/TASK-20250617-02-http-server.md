## User Story
As a developer
I want to create a basic HTTP server using Go's net/http package
So that I can serve API endpoints on port 8080

## Acceptance Criteria
- HTTP server starts on port 8080
- Server logs startup message with timestamp
- Server handles graceful shutdown
- Basic route registered at `/hello`
- Server returns 404 for undefined routes
- Error handling for server startup failures

## Gherkin Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: HTTP Server

Scenario: Server starts successfully
  Given the application is launched
  When the server initializes
  Then it should listen on port 8080
  And log "Starting server on :8080"

Scenario: Server handles shutdown gracefully
  Given the server is running
  When a shutdown signal is received
  Then the server should close all connections
  And exit cleanly
```

## Testing & Validation Steps
- Unit tests using net/http/httptest
- Verify server starts on correct port
- Test graceful shutdown handling
- Validate error messages for port conflicts
- Manual testing with curl or browser
- Load testing for concurrent connections
