# Tasks Management Directive

## Overview

This document outlines the standardized approach for creating, managing, and tracking tasks and bugs in the project. This Golang project requires rigorous task management to ensure consistency, traceability, and quality delivery across multi-process, multi-threaded, containerized cloud deployments.

## Folder Structure

```
tasks/
├── active/          # Currently in progress
├── complete/        # Finished tasks
├── backlog/         # Prioritized work queue
└── archive/         # Completed tasks moved for historical reference
```

## Task Types

### Task Tickets
Use for feature development, enhancements, and general work items.

### Bug Tickets  
Use for defects, issues, and fixes.

## Ticket Template

### Header Format
```
# [TASK|BUG]-{YYYYMMDD}-{NN} - {Title}
Status: [ACTIVE|COMPLETE|BACKLOG|ARCHIVE]
Priority: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
Assignee: {Name}
Created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
Updated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
```

### Required Sections

#### User Story
```
As a [user type]
I want [functionality]  
So that [benefit/value]
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Clear, testable conditions
- Use "Given/When/Then" format when appropriate
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Performance requirements for multi-threaded operations
- Security validation requirements
- Container deployment validation

#### Gherkin Scenarios (When Appropriate)
```gherkin
Feature: {Feature Name}

Scenario: {Scenario Name}
  Given {precondition}
  When {action}
  Then {expected result}
```

#### Testing & Validation Steps
- Unit test requirements (Go testing framework)
- Integration test scenarios  
- Manual testing checklist
- Performance criteria (concurrent operations)
- Security considerations (enterprise security standards)
- Container and Kubernetes deployment tests
- Multi-process coordination tests

#### Behavioral Contract
- Define the complete interface contract including:
  - All inputs (parameters, headers, body formats)
  - All outputs (success responses, error responses, status codes)
  - State transitions and side effects
  - Integration points with other components
- Specify invariants that must hold across all scenarios
- Document assumptions and constraints

#### Parent/Sub Tasks
- Parent Task: Link to parent ticket
- Sub Tasks: List of dependent work items
- Dependencies: External blockers or prerequisites

#### Cross-Task Validation
- Identify all interfaces this task exposes or consumes
- List integration points with other tasks
- Define shared data structures and conventions
- Specify compatibility requirements
- Document any breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Numbering Convention

Format: `{TYPE}-{YYYYMMDD}-{NN}`
- TYPE: TASK or BUG
- YYYYMMDD: Creation date
- NN: Sequential number (01, 02, etc.)

Examples:
- `TASK-20250614-01`
- `BUG-20250614-02`

## Status Management

### Active
- Currently being worked on
- Should have assignee and target completion date
- Regular updates required

### Complete  
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and merged
- Tests passing (unit, integration, performance)
- Documentation updated
- Container builds successfully
- Kubernetes deployment validated

### Backlog
- Prioritized and ready for work
- Requirements clearly defined
- Dependencies identified

### Archive
- Completed tasks moved for historical reference
- Quarterly cleanup recommended

## Development Standards

### Small Commits
- Each commit should represent a single logical change
- Commit messages must reference ticket number
- Format: `{TICKET-ID}: {Brief description}`

### High Testing Coverage
- Minimum 85% code coverage for new features
- All bug fixes must include regression tests
- Critical paths require 95%+ coverage
- Concurrent operation tests required
- Performance benchmarks for multi-threaded code
- **Contract-Driven Testing**:
  - Tests must validate the complete behavioral contract
  - Test data and assertions must reflect real-world usage
  - Cross-component integration must be validated
  - Tests should be the executable specification

### Modular Code
- Single responsibility principle
- Clear interfaces and abstractions
- Minimal coupling between modules
- Comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Go best practices and idioms
- Thread-safe implementations
- Proper error handling and propagation

## Enterprise Standards

### Security Requirements
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure error handling (no sensitive data in logs)
- Authentication and authorization integration
- Encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment

### Performance Requirements
- Benchmark tests for critical paths
- Memory usage profiling
- Concurrent operation validation
- Load testing for multi-process scenarios
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Cloud-Native Standards
- Container-first design
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Configuration via environment variables
- Logging and observability integration
- Horizontal scaling support

## Workflow Process

1. **Task Creation**
   - Use template format
   - Place in appropriate folder
   - Assign priority and initial status

2. **Development**
   - Move to `active/` folder
   - Create feature branch: `{ticket-id}-{brief-description}`
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Write tests first (TDD approach)
   - Implement with thread safety in mind
   - **System Coherence**:
     - Validate consistency with existing components
     - Ensure contracts align across task boundaries
     - Verify end-to-end scenarios work as expected

3. **Review & Testing**
   - Code review required before merge
   - All tests must pass (unit, integration, performance)
   - Coverage thresholds must be met
   - Security review completed
   - Container build validation
   - Manual testing completed

4. **Completion**
   - Update ticket status
   - Move to `complete/` folder
   - Merge to main branch
   - Deploy to staging/production if applicable

5. **Archive**
   - Quarterly review of completed tasks
   - Move old completed items to `archive/`
   - Maintain searchable history

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing (unit, integration, performance)
- [ ] Coverage thresholds met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Container builds successfully
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment validated
- [ ] Multi-process coordination tested
- [ ] Thread safety verified

### Pre-Completion Validation
- [ ] All behavioral contracts validated
- [ ] Cross-task integration verified
- [ ] End-to-end scenarios tested
- [ ] No compilation warnings or errors
- [ ] All dependencies properly managed
- [ ] Interface compatibility confirmed

## Best Practices

- Keep tasks small and focused (1-3 days max)
- Write clear, actionable acceptance criteria
- Include relevant context and background
- Link related tickets and dependencies
- Update status regularly during development
- Retrospective feedback on completed work
- Consider concurrency implications in all designs
- Plan for horizontal scaling from the start
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Task Definition Excellence

### Completeness Principle
Every task must define:
1. **What** - The functionality to implement
2. **How** - The interface contracts and behaviors
3. **Why** - The rationale and constraints
4. **With** - The integration requirements
5. **Proof** - The validation criteria

### System Thinking
- No task exists in isolation
- Define how components interact
- Specify shared conventions early
- Document interface evolution
- Consider the full lifecycle

### Executable Specifications
- Acceptance criteria must be testable
- Examples should be runnable
- Contracts must be enforceable
- Integration must be verifiable

## Tools Integration

This directive supports integration with:
- Git workflow and branch naming
- Go testing framework and benchmarking
- CI/CD pipeline requirements (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Code coverage tools (go cover)
- Container build systems (Docker, Podman)
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Security scanning tools
- Performance monitoring and profiling tools
- Project management systems
- Documentation generators
